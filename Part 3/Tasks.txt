Problem Description: 
This part of the project is composed the following tasks: 
Task 1: Spidering and indexing  
Now, you need to work on the entire document corpus “rfh.zip”. You can download “rfh.zip” from the Blackboard. For this task, you shall complete a spider which takes input file “index.html” from the folder “rhf/”. From this input html file, your spider shall be able to collect every document in “rhf/”. You only need to index “.html” or “.htm” files. For each web page, apply your indexer from Part 2 to index it. 
Additional job: If you haven’t considered anchor texts in Part 2, please extract those and include them in your indices. 
Task 2: Testing and Revising of Interface and Search functions
 Test your interfaces and search functions from Part 2. Make sure they work for the entire corpus. 
Additional  job: Make the search results (the links) clickable.
